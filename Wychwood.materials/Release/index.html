		<p>You have just been released from prison where

		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unaware that he was talking in his sleep, Jonesy
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives you a very good idea of where he hid
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last from a bank robbery
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are sure it is hidden somewhere near
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wychwood Manor. To a man with your

	<h2>Reimplementing a classic BBC Micro text adventure</h2>
	<p>Picking up the text adventure authoring software The Quill as soon as it was released, Geoff Larsen published six games over the course of four years. He garnered nearly instant acclaim for his moody atmospheres and ingenious puzzles.</p>
	<p>Sold for a few pounds each, Larsoft's games show a deep knowledge of The Quill, with a particular fascination with real-time puzzles. For example, in Wychwood, you have a limited number of turns to complete the adventure.</p>
	<h3>Why Wychwood?</h3>
	<p>Interactive fiction is typically thought of as an enthusiast's genre. The UK Microcomputer Scene was filled with enthusiasts who just wanted to create.</p>
	<p>Geoff Larsen was seemingly just a person who made some cool games. And Wychwood is one of the best examples of an early microcomputer text adventure written in The Quill.</p>
	<p>To be fair, the game is crude: signposting is spotty and multiple softlocks exist. For context in the scope of mainstream commercial interactive fiction: Wychwood was released the same year as A Mind Forever Voyaging in the US and The Pawn in the UK.</p>
	<p>Many interactive fiction fans have never heard of Larsoft's games, even though his games were considered a gold standard of a specific type of game at a specific time. With some interesting plot threads, a few solid puzzles, a timer-based game loop, and some design choices worth debating and talking about, I personally found Wychwood extremely compelling not only as a period study, but as a parser game design example.</p>
	<h2>Gameplay Notes</h2>
	<p>This reimplementation is based on playthroughs of the E4 Version available on the Complete BBC Micro Games Archive.</p>
	<p>While the goal was to recreate the experience of playing the original game, there are six major changes to the game:</p>
	<ul><li>There are room names to keep with current parser conventions.</li>
		<li>The garden door no longer locks behind you, removing a brutal softlock.</li>
		<li>You can "OPEN" drawers.</li>
		<li>The help text is available using "HELP," instead of showing after the intro text.</li>
		<li>The story file may show a title bar with the room name and current game time.</li>
		<li>Not every default response was re-written from the Inform defaults.</ul>
	<h2>Development Notes</h2>
	<p>The development for this game, for better or for worse, was <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/collections/GDNTeOXVNBdu-w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">streamed live on Twitch</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/ferkungamaboobo/wychwood-inform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>
